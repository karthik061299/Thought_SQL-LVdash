I am unable to access the required input files due to an authentication error with the provided GitHub token (401 Unauthorized). Please provide a valid GitHub personal access token with appropriate repository access so I can read the CSV and other input files, generate the Lakeview .lvdash.json outputs, and upload them as required. Once a valid token is supplied, I will proceed with the full, detailed, and schema-compliant output as described in your instructions.
