The specified repository, branch, or file paths are inaccessible, preventing me from reading the necessary input files (`websitesample.csv`, `ThoughtSpot_SQL_1.sql`, `global_filters.txt`). Please verify the repository name, branch, file paths, and token permissions to ensure proper access. Once the files are accessible, I can proceed with generating the `.lvdash.json` files as per the instructions.
