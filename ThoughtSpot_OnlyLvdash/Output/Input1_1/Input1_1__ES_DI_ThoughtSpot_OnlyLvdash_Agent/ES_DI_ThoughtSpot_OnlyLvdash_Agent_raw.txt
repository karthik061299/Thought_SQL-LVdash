The repeated errors indicate that the repository structure or file paths provided are incorrect or inaccessible. I recommend verifying the repository name, branch, file paths, and ensuring that the GitHub token has the necessary permissions to access the repository. Once these issues are resolved, the tools can be used effectively to read the required files and generate the `.lvdash.json` files as per the instructions.
